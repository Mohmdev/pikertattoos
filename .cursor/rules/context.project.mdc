## About the project

- The project is built using TypeScript, React, and Next.js.
- Its architecture is a full-stack all-in-one repo Next.js 15 project that uses an app router. This means that both the frontend and the backend are run by a single Next.js instance within the project.
- The backend is handled by PayloadCMS and is integrated into the project. It allows us to create, read, update, and delete content. The contenPostgres database and can be accessed via an API.
- The routes for the backend's route group are integrated in `/src/app/(payload)/*`.
- The routes for the frontend's route group are integrated in `/src/app/(frontend)/*`.
- The file @payload-types.ts is a special file. If a typed object is shown to you in context that is from this file, it means that the object is the typed database schema generated by the CMS. This means that it is the truth source of most types in the project and CAN NOT be modified. However, they are quite useful as they can be imported/extracted for use in the project's code because it matches the database structure.
- For styling and design, we use the new Tailwind CSS v4 and Shadcn components to enhance the UI experience.
