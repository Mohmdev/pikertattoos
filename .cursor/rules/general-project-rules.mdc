# Rule content

- This project is a full-stack all-in-one repo Nextjs 15 project that uses app router. Meaning, that both the frontend and the backend are run by a single Nextjs instance within our project. The backend is handled by Payloadcms and is integrated into the project. Finally, the frontend and the app router are integrated in '/src/app/(frontend)/*'.

- If the types added to context are from the file [payload-types.ts](mdc:src/payload-types.ts), it means that they are the typed database schema generated by the CMS. This means that they are the truth source of most types in the project and must not be changed at all. But it also means that they could be imported/extracted to be used in the project's code which is helpful as they match the database structure.
