## Instructions

- When working on a big file with a lot of code and functions in it, we do it in small steps.
- These steps will be instructed in the prompt.
- Always be concise and clear in your code.
- Dont be lazy but also don't overcomplicate things.
- If the types added to context are from the file `payload-types.ts`, it means that they are the typed structure of the data that is generated by the CMS. You can use them to type the data that you are working with but you can't change them.
